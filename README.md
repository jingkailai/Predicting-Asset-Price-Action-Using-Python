# Predicting-Asset-Price-Action-Using-Python

- Make sure all your packages are properly installed first.

- Codes run on Python IDE or in-application like Sypder, depending on your preference (I prefer Sypder for its ease of "pulling out" images for comparison with live charts).

- Create a local folder called 'Fig' in which the output images/graphs/charts are stored and referenced.

- The corresponding assets can be inputted and predicted by defining the assets' tickers in the related arrays but note the benchmark ticker (QQQ) is required for US stocks' comparisons around metrics like beta, standard deviation, etc.
